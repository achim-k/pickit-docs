Saving a snapshot in Pick-it
============================

A snapshot is a powerful support tool of Pick-it. In a snapshot both the
camera images and detection parameters of the last detection are stored.
This file can be downloaded and send to anybody with a Pick-it system.
This tool allows anybody to give you remote support without a direct
connection to your system.

By saving and sending a Pick-it snapshot to Pick-it support. A Pick-it
support engineer will analyze your scenario and will give you feedback
on your detection settings.

#. Press the \ **Detect** button under the Pick-it viewer to make sure
   you capture the current scene.
   You have to do this every time you are saving a new snapshot,
   otherwise, the new data is not captured and old data is being saved.
#. Press the yellow **Snapshot** button in the lower left of the Pick-it
   viewer.

.. hint::
   When sending a snapshot to Pick-it Support it's always very helpful when
   you send multiple snapshots of different situations:
   - Scene almost empty
   - Scene with a few objects
   - Scene in a starting situation
   - The object you want to pick on its own (only when using TEACH)
