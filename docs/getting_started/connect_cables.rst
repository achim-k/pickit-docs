Connect the cables
==================

In this step, we will connect all the cables to the Pick-it processor.
Note that all the ports on the back of the Pick-it processor are
correctly labeled. See the image below for an overview of all necessary
connections. Follow the steps below to connect the processor:

-  Connect the processor to the power outlet with the provided cable.
-  Connect the Pick-it camera with the 10m USB cable (CBL-USB-CAM-10)
   and plug it into the CAMERA labeled USB port at the back side of the
   Pick-it processor. When the Pick-it camera is connected correctly, a
   continuous green light is lit on front of the Pick-it camera.

.. warning:: A USB hub is not allowed between the Pick-it processor and
   camera connection.


-  Connect the gray/black 5m UTP network cable (CBL-CAT6-GRAY-5
   / CBL-CAT6-BLACK-5) from your computer to the YOUR PC labeled RJ45
   port on the Pick-it processor.
-  Connect the green 5m UTP network cable (CBL-CAT6-GREEN-5) from your
   robot or machine controller with the ROBOT labeled RJ45 port at the
   back side of the Pick-it processor.

.. note:: The last step, the connection to a robot, is not necessary to
   already test the Pick-it system.
