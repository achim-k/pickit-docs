Your first detection
====================

Now that all connections are tested we can start our first detection.
For this we'll use a soda can. Note that this is the final step of this
quick start guide that you can still complete without having a robot.
Follow the steps below to do your first detection with Pick-it:

-  Make sure that the Pick-it camera is mounted 700mm above a flat work
   space. The work space is now seen in the 2D viewer on the Pick-it
   user interface.
-  In the Pick-it user interface press Stop Robot Mode.
-  In the Configuration tab under create a new setup and/or product fill
   in 'Test\_Pickit' twice and press Create.
-  Place the three workspace markers, according the indicated arrows,
   inside the field of view of the camera.
-  Go to the Region of Interest > ROI Box filter and press Use Markers.
   Wait till the blue box is updated. 
-  Set following values for Zmin and Zmax: 10mm and 150mm.
-  Press the Save button.

-  In the Detection tab select Pick-it Teach. 
-  Now place a soda can on his side in the middle of the marks.
-  Under define your model(s) press Add a model. Now the model view is
   opened and a point cloud of the soda can is shown.

   arrows) appears above the soda can.
-  Place the soda can somewhere else in between the markers and press
   Detect again.
-  Press the Save button.
-  Congratulations with your first detections!
